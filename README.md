## Welcome to My Blog

In our first lesson we learn't about what the following terms mean:

Denial of service – This is where the attacker wants to make the system unavailable to function. This done by overwhelming the system with various requests until eventually normal traffic is not able to pass through or be processed. A single computer is used to launch the attack. 

Back Door – This an attack that occurs when a type of malware is used to gain unauthorized access to a system. The criminal will flood the system with this malicious malware which will enter through unsecured points of the system these unsecure points are things such as outdated plug-ins.  

Spoofing - Packets have a modified source address which will hide the identity of the sender meaning it will act like a different computer system.   

Mathematical - An attack on a key containing a small data set 

Brute Force – The attacker will guess many passwords in the hope that he will be granted access to the system. 

Software Exploitation – This is an attack that’s takes advantage of software vulnerability so that it can attack the computer system. 

Virus - This is a computer program that when activated within a computer will replicate itself by changing other computer programs as a result the computer system will become infected with the original virus that is replicating 

Rootkit – This is a collection of malicious software which will grant attackers access to the computer system or to a piece of software within the system. 

Worms – This is a computer program that will replicate itself so it can infect other computers. It will use on computer as a host and then will scan and infect other computers as a result by replicating itself. 

Trojan - Any application that masquerades as one thing in order to get past scrutiny and then does something malicious. One of the major differences between Trojan horses and viruses is that Trojan horses tend not to replicate themselves. This will also make users think that it is for another purpose than it is. 

Spyware – This malicious malware that will aim to enter the computer system and then steal all its relevant info. This info will then be sent to another entity so that it will harm the user this could be by violating their privacy. 

Adware – This when advertisements that aren't necessary display when browsing the web. Adware will use your browsing history to display adverts that interest you. This can become annoying for users as they don’t want ads to disrupt what they are reading.
